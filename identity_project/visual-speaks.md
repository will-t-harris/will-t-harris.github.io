I plan to get to my final image by continuing to learn when I finish the bootcamp.  I already am trying to inundate myself with tech knowledge and the current machinations of the tech world.  I plan to continue listening to technology podcasts, working through tutorials and creating projects for technologies I am interested in, and pushing my technological understanding throughout my career.  I think that if I keep at it I will absolutely reach my goal in the next couple of years. The only thing that could prevent me, would be my deciding to give up.
