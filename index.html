			<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>
			<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
			<p>Auditory: 35%</p>
			<p>Visual: 35%</p>
			<p>Tactile: 30%</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Quantitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Rode a bike 1700 miles down the Pacific coast over 33 days in October 2018.  About 81,000 feet of overall elevation gain.</li>
				<li>Trained and oversaw 20+ front of house restaurant workers over 3 years as a restaurant manager. </li>
				<li>Organised, facilitated, and demonstrated 18+ practica for the junior laboratory program in my role as a teacher's assistant my senior year at St. John's College.  A couple examples are a direct measurement of the speed of light and the construction of a large Faraday cage.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Assiduous</strong> -- Once I decide to do something, there is very little that can prevent me from following through.  This is a strength because I can see things through and get things done.  This can be a weakness because, if I am on the wrong path, I can end up wasting time that could have been better spent elsewhere.</li>
				<li><strong>Sensitive to nuance</strong> -- I tend to be able to see both sides of an argument.  This is a strength because it provides me with a fundamental flexibility of thought.  This can be a weakness when it leads to indecision -- sometimes if I need to come down strongly on one side or the other I can have a hard time being decisive.</li>
				<li><strong>Principled</strong> -- I value personal principles.  I respect people who move through the world according to the things they believe in.  This can be a strength because it affords a degree of determination and confidence that I find valuable in the world.  This can be a weakness because it can lead to a type of close-mindedness when considering options that appear to go against these principles.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>What motivates me more than anything across all of my interests is the importance of autonomy and personal freedom.  This motivation informs my interest in programming.  As long as we have access to a free and open internet, we can realistically learn from and communicate with anyone, which I believe fundamentally supports personal freedom and autonomy.  My fascination with bikes ties into this motivation as well: I think the self-sufficiency and independence that bikes allow can be enabling for people.  My partner spent soe time teaching English to children in Tanzania, and she has described to me how some of the kids would run three to five miles to school in the morning so that they could make it to class on time.  The power of a bicycle to enable a person in that situation is huge.  I view the autonomy of transportation provided by bicycles as an analog to the autonomy of expression and communication facilitated by the free and open internet.</p>
			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why:</strong> I believe it is important to leave the world a better place than I found it.  I want to support online autonomy and privacy to help safe-guard the free and open exchange of ideas.</li>
				<li><strong>How:</strong> Code.</li>
				<li><strong>What:</strong> Working to support internet privacy, security, and accessibility.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi my name is Will. I work on browsers to help protect people's online privacy and to help keep the web free,
				open, and accessible for everyone. I use web technologies to achieve this goal.
				Have you thought about your online privacy?</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>I had a great time this first week of class.  I'm really enjoying the pace and intensity that's been established so far, and I'm looking forward to things getting more difficult. A lot of the material on the DOM and front-end code I was already pretty familiar with, but the UI/UX and data design stuff is new to me and is more complex than I anticipated.  I'm having a bit of a hard time fully grasping how to think of data relations in the way they're asking us to, but I'm definitely finding it interesting to think about data in this way.  Just an an aside, I can tell that I'm genuinely enjoying myself because I had several moments on Saturday where I caught myself wishing I were still in class!</p>
			<p>Also feeling like I made the right call deciding to take the train down from Santa Fe rather than driving.  It's been very helpful to still be able to keep up with my mindfulness/reading practice in the mornings, and it's great having a couple hours on the way home to work on things for class.</p>
