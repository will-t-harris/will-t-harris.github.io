			<br>
			<h3>Quantitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Rode a bike 1700 miles down the Pacific coast over 33 days in October 2018.  About 81,000 feet of overall elevation gain.</li>
				<li>Trained and oversaw 20+ front of house restaurant workers over 3 years as a restaurant manager. </li>
				<li>Organised, facilitated, and demonstrated 18+ practica for the junior laboratory program in my role as a teacher's assistant my senior year at St. John's College.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sedulous/Assiduous</strong> -- Once I decide to do something, there is very little that can prevent me from following through.  This is a strength because I can see things through and get things done.  This can be a weakness because, if I am on the wrong path, I can end up wasting time that could have been better spent elsewhere.</li>
				<li><strong>Sensitive to nuance</strong> -- I tend to be able to see both sides of an argument.  This is a strength because it provides me with a fundamental flexibility of thought.  This can be a weakness when it leads to indecision -- sometimes if I need to come down strongly on one side or the other I can have a hard time being decisive.</li>
				<li><strong>Principled</strong> -- I value personal principles.  I respect people who move through the world according to the things they believe in.  This can be a strength because it affords a degree of determination and confidence that I find valuable in the world.  This can be a weakness because it can lead to a type of close-mindedness when considering options that appear to go against these principles.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>I am passionate about bicycles.  I eventually want to start building my own steel bike frames and forks as soon as I have a space that would make a decent workshop.  My fascination with bikes ties in with my motivation behind programming: I think the self-sufficiency and independence that bikes allow can be enabling for people.  My partner spent some time teaching English to children in Tanzania, and she has described for me how some of the kids would run three to five miles to school in the morning so that they could make it in time.  The power of a bicycle to enable a person in that situation is huge!  I view the autonomy of transportation provided by bicycles as an analog to the autonomy of expression and communication facilitated by the free and open internet.  As long as I have a bike, I can realistically travel most anywhere.  As long as we have access to an open internet, we can realistically learn from and communicate with anyone, which I believe fundamentally supports personal freedom and autonomy.</p>
			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why:</strong> I believe it is important to leave the world a better place than I found it.  I want to support online autonomy and privacy to help safe-guard the free and open exchange of ideas.</li>
				<li><strong>How:</strong> code.</li>
				<li><strong>What:</strong> Working to support internet privacy, security, and accessibility.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi my name is Will. I work on browsers to help protect people's online privacy and to help keep the web free,
				open, and accessible for everyone. I use web technologies to achieve this goal.
				Have you thought about your online privacy?</p>
