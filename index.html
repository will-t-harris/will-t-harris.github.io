			<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>
			<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
			<p>Auditory: 35%</p>
			<p>Visual: 35%</p>
			<p>Tactile: 30%</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Quantitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Rode a bike 1700 miles down the Pacific coast over 33 days in October 2018.  About 81,000 feet of overall elevation gain.</li>
				<li>Trained and oversaw 20+ front of house restaurant workers over 3 years as a restaurant manager. </li>
				<li>Organised, facilitated, and demonstrated 18+ practica for the junior laboratory program in my role as a teacher's assistant my senior year at St. John's College.  A couple examples are a direct measurement of the speed of light and the construction of a large Faraday cage.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Assiduous</strong> -- Once I decide to do something, there is very little that can prevent me from following through.  This is a strength because I can see things through and get things done.  This can be a weakness because, if I am on the wrong path, I can end up wasting time that could have been better spent elsewhere.</li>
				<li><strong>Sensitive to nuance</strong> -- I tend to be able to see both sides of an argument.  This is a strength because it provides me with a fundamental flexibility of thought.  This can be a weakness when it leads to indecision -- sometimes if I need to come down strongly on one side or the other I can have a hard time being decisive.</li>
				<li><strong>Principled</strong> -- I value personal principles.  I respect people who move through the world according to the things they believe in.  This can be a strength because it affords a degree of determination and confidence that I find valuable in the world.  This can be a weakness because it can lead to a type of close-mindedness when considering options that appear to go against these principles.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>What motivates me more than anything across all of my interests is the importance of autonomy and personal freedom.  This motivation informs my interest in programming.  As long as we have access to a free and open internet, we can realistically learn from and communicate with anyone, which I believe fundamentally supports personal freedom and autonomy.  My fascination with bikes ties into this motivation as well: I think the self-sufficiency and independence that bikes allow can be enabling for people.  My partner spent soe time teaching English to children in Tanzania, and she has described to me how some of the kids would run three to five miles to school in the morning so that they could make it to class on time.  The power of a bicycle to enable a person in that situation is huge.  I view the autonomy of transportation provided by bicycles as an analog to the autonomy of expression and communication facilitated by the free and open internet.</p>
			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why:</strong> I believe it is important to leave the world a better place than I found it.  I want to support online autonomy and privacy to help safe-guard the free and open exchange of ideas.</li>
				<li><strong>How:</strong> Code.</li>
				<li><strong>What:</strong> Working to support internet privacy, security, and accessibility.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi my name is Will. I work on browsers to help protect people's online privacy and to help keep the web free,
				open, and accessible for everyone. I use web technologies to achieve this goal.
				Have you thought about your online privacy?</p>
			<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
			<img src="assets/visualSpeaks.jpg" alt="images for visual speaks exercise" id="visualSpeaks" />
			<p>I plan to get to my second image by continuing to learn when I finish the bootcamp. I already am trying to inundate myself with tech knowledge and the current machinations of the tech world. I plan to continue listening to technology podcasts, working through tutorials and creating projects with technologies I am interested in, and pushing my technological understanding throughout my career. I think that if I keep at it I will absolutely reach my goal in the next couple of years. The only thing that could prevent me would be my deciding to give up.</p>

			<h3>Reflections from Board Game Exercise</h3>
			<p>During the board game exercise I found myself struggling to get started until I understood all of the rules.  I also realised at a certain point that I was generally the only one trying to find answers in the rule book.  I'm not sure if why this was the case.  Once I understood the game, I found myself trying to think more strategically about how to get us to the winning condition.  Unfortunately we were not able to successfully finish the game, but we came really close!</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>I had a great time this first week of class.  I'm really enjoying the pace and intensity that's been established so far, and I'm looking forward to things getting more difficult. A lot of the material on the DOM and front-end code I was already pretty familiar with, but the UI/UX and data design stuff is new to me and is more complex than I anticipated.  I'm having a bit of a hard time fully grasping how to think of data relations in the way they're asking us to, but I'm definitely finding it interesting to think about data in this way.  Just an an aside, I can tell that I'm genuinely enjoying myself because I had several moments on Saturday where I caught myself wishing I were still in class!</p>
			<p>Also feeling like I made the right call deciding to take the train down from Santa Fe rather than driving.  It's been very helpful to still be able to keep up with my mindfulness/reading practice in the mornings, and it's great having a couple hours on the way home to work on things for class.</p>

			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>Week 2 was another busy week, we made significant progress with our Object Oriented projects and brainstormed capstone project ideas.  Looking forward to seeing who is on my team, and what capstone project we will be working on.</p>
			<p>I'm a little ahead of the class right now, I was able to get most of the Object Oriented stuff done fairly quickly.  I'm already finished with Phase 2, which is due this upcoming Wednesday morning.  Paul asked me to write up some more example classes for the ERDs we made in the data design project to give me some more practice with this sort of thing.  Hoping to get a good shot at those done over the weekend.</p>
			<p>An apprenticeship with Twitter came across my radar this week, and I'm going to apply for it.  It would be an engineer internship either in San Francisco or in Boulder, with the opportunity to continue on at Twitter if the internship goes well.  I'm really hoping I can get noticed for this, as it would be a huge step forward for me.  Deadline is July 31, so I have a bit of time, but I'll need to manage my time well to fit this into everything else that we are doing.</p>

			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>This week covered a lot of ground.</p>
			<p>We got assigned PWP Milestone 2a, due this upcoming Thursday.  I've gotten a good start on this milestone already -- I'm pretty sure my wireframes are good to go.  I just need to think about the plan for my content sections.</p>
			<p>We covered git branching and git-flow.  This was really cool to learn, as I've always wondered if there was a proper system for dealing with branching.  It makes sense, looking back at it now, that a project would want to have an entirely separate master branch for production-level code, with all of the development being done in discrete stages above the master branch.  I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with this type of work-flow.</p>
			<p>We also had a very brief introduction to CSS.  I was rather surprised with how cursory of a look we got at the entire system.  I think part of the issue was a time constraint, but CSS is a big part of front-end development.  I'd have thought we'd get into greater detail.  I guess they must just be confident that we will be able to figure it out as we go.</p>
			<p>For our capstone we were able to burn down three tickets on Friday, which is great.  We're in a good position going into the second week of sprint 1 -- I'm optimistic we can get a head start on sprint 2 later this week.</p>
			<p>Also, I'm submitting the Twitter apprenticeship application this week.  I'm pretty happy with my cover letter and the current iteration of my resume.  I'm pretty confident I'll at least get a phone screen.</p>
