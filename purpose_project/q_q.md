1. WHY: I want to work on tools that help protect people's privacy online.  I also want to work in tech/development because
I want to learn a trade that will allow me to keep learning and advancing my skills continuously.
1. HOW: With web technologies. I think I want to focus more on the JavaScript ecosystem, but that might just be because it is
the language I am most comfortable with at the moment.
1. WHAT: I want to either work on web browsers with a privacy focus (Firefox/Brave/Duch Duck Go/etc), or work on tools that
help protect people's privacy/security online (think password managers maybe/tracker blocking extensions/VPN tech).

PATH:
I am going to focus on the employee path.

ELEVATOR PITCH:  Hi my name is Will.  I work on browsers to help protect people's online privacy and to help keep the web
 free, open, and accessible for everyone.  I'm (come through more with currently being skilled as a tech worker)learning web development to achieve this goal.  Have you thought about 
 your online privacy?
