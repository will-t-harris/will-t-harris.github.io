#### QUALITATIVE
1.	Loyal: I stand by those close to me.  This is a strength because I form close relationships to those I care about.  This is a weakness because it can lead to me staying with a person (or company!) for longer than is good for me.
2.	Hard working: Once I decide to do something, there is very little that can prevent me from following through.  This is a strength because I can get things done.  This can be a weakness because if I am on the wrong path, I can end up wasting time that could have been better spent on something else.

1. WHY: I want to work on tools that help protect people's privacy online.  I also want to work in tech/development because
I want to learn a trade that will allow me to keep learning and advancing my skills continuously.
1. HOW: With web technologies. I think I want to focus more on the JavaScript ecosystem, but that might just be because it is
the language I am most comfortable with at the moment.
1. WHAT: I want to either work on web browsers with a privacy focus (Firefox/Brave/Duch Duck Go/etc), or work on tools that
help protect people's privacy/security online (think password managers maybe/tracker blocking extensions/VPN tech).

#### PATH:
I am going to focus on the employee path.

#### ELEVATOR PITCH:  
Hi my name is Will.  I work on browsers to help protect people's online privacy and to help keep the web
 free, open, and accessible for everyone.  I'm (come through more with currently being skilled as a tech worker)learning web development to achieve this goal.  Have you thought about your online privacy?
 
 #### Full Brain Paragraph
I am passionate about bicycles.  I eventually want to start building my own steel bike frames and forks as soon as I have a space that would make a decent workshop.  My fascination with bikes ties in with my motivation behind programming: I think the self-sufficiency and independence that bikes allow can be enabling for people.  My partner spent some time teaching English to children in Tanzania, and she has described for me how some of the kids would run three to five miles to school in the morning so that they could make it in time.  The power of a bicycle to enable a person in that situation is huge!  I view the autonomy of transportation provided by bicycles as an analog to the autonomy of expression and communication facilitated by the free and open internet.  As long as I have a bike, I can realistically travel most anywhere.  As long as we have access to an open internet, we can realistically learn from and communicate with anyone.
